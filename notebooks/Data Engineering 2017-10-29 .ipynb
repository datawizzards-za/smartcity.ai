       " 'KEY ROLETo support the CIO in ensuring new strategic and tactical opportunities are executed effectively and responsibly.A line management position responsible for providing consolidated feedback on performance of the project management, business analysis and development teams to the CIO.To assist the CIO with the development, implementation and maintenance of good-practices relating to managing projects, with the intention of establishing a school-wide change management capability under the CIO.A senior project manager responsible for specific projects identified during the 2016 period by the CIO.To complement existing business analysis, training and support functions where capacity or skills are inadequate, and in particular to be able to work with senior business people on cross-divisional business opportunities such as process optimisation.TEAM CULTUREDelivery is \"agile\" in the sense that new projects arise often, and efforts get reprioritised frequently. Individuals in the team, particularly the BA\\'s, operate very independently, and the management style of this person must almost appear to be \"servant\" based - i.e. to remove the barriers so the technical experts can get on with adding value. The staff are experts and should not feel like they have a new \"boss\".Hierarchy and egos do not work in this team. Some characteristics of this position should be collaborative, humble, servant-leader, flexible, resilient, people-centric, customer-centric.This team is core to business success and therefore resources in the team need access directly to the CIO or various other stakeholders. The CIO will spend a lot of time with individuals, and may expect these people to independently engage other people in the school, or even outside. Working \"through\" the manager on projects is considered inefficient, so this person must be able to figure out how such a hybrid model would work.Responsibilities include but are not limited to :Primary - Line Manager: Taking cognisance of the above cultural points, provide a single point of responsibility for the \"change the business\" function in IT, which includes project management, software development (or implementation), and management reporting.Manage and report on commercials (financials, contracts etc.) for the CIO.Line manager for staff in this team. The style of this is critical - servant leadership is the key concept. The person will (with input from the CIO) be responsible for performance management and personal development of this team.Ensure appropriate risk management is implemented and reported on.Oversee any other administrative work required in the division.As and when required, act as a communication channel to and from the CIO. The CIO would like direct access to the technical resources but is responsible for four teams and needs assistance with the day-to-day management of this team.Primary: Project Officer. Assisting the CIO to establish and then run the Project Management Office with good-practices for portfolio, programme and project management aligned to GIBS\\' culture and business style. The outcome should be an operationalised structure which can work independently of resources, and should include as a minimum, peer accepted:Customised but formalised project management frameworks (processes, artefacts etc.) that suit GIBS\\' business style while enforcing required governance principles.Education, support, and supervision of supporting staff in the methodologies.Development and maintenance of appropriate documentation and standards relating to every project.Reporting as required by all levels of management across all key projects.Integration into operations Change and Release processes.Provision of a supporting \"shared service\" function to the rest of business to assist with all significant projects.Assist IT DevOps with testing and review processes where required.Primary - Project Manager: Either directly or by working with a resource, take responsibility for key IT projects in line with good project management and governance practices. Key projects can be:Business value adding projects, such as process optimisation or implementation of digital solutions for learning.High priority and complex IT projects such as large system upgrades or implementations.Secondary: The person should be familiar with organisational design and business process design and be able to consult with the whole organisation, along with the business analysts (who would be primary in these roles, but more focused on specific work) on opportunities for improvement.Secondary: Identify and filter to the CIO any opportunities which may benefit GIBS as an organisation, which the PMO might be able to initiate and execute.',\n",

Individuals in the team, particularly the BA\\'s, operate very independently, and the management style of this person must almost appear to be \"servant\" based - i.e. to remove the barriers so the technical experts can get on with adding value. The staff are experts and should not feel like they have a new \"boss\".Hierarchy and egos do not work in this team. Some characteristics of this position should be collaborative, humble, servant-leader, flexible, resilient, people-centric, customer-centric.This team is core to business success and therefore resources in the team need access directly to the CIO or various other stakeholders. The CIO will spend a lot of time with individuals, and may expect these people to independently engage other people in the school, or even outside. Working \"through\" the manager on projects is considered inefficient, so this person must be able to figure out how such a hybrid model would work.Responsibilities include but are not limited to :Primary - Line Manager: Taking cognisance of the above cultural points, provide a single point of responsibility for the \"change the business\" function in IT, which includes project management, software development (or implementation), and management reporting.Manage and report on commercials (financials, contracts etc.) for the CIO.Line manager for staff in this team. The style of this is critical - servant leadership is the key concept. The person will (with input from the CIO) be responsible for performance management and personal development of this team.Ensure appropriate risk management is implemented and reported on.Oversee any other administrative work required in the division.As and when required, act as a communication channel to and from the CIO. The CIO would like direct access to the technical resources but is responsible for four teams and needs assistance with the day-to-day management of this team.Primary: Project Officer. Assisting the CIO to establish and then run the Project Management Office with good-practices for portfolio, programme and project management aligned to GIBS\\' culture and business style. The outcome should be an operationalised structure which can work independently of resources, and should include as a minimum, peer accepted:Customised but formalised project management frameworks (processes, artefacts etc.) that suit GIBS\\' business style while enforcing required governance principles.Education, support, and supervision of supporting staff in the methodologies.Development and maintenance of appropriate documentation and standards relating to every project.Reporting as required by all levels of management across all key projects.Integration into operations Change and Release processes.Provision of a supporting \"shared service\" function to the rest of business to assist with all significant projects.Assist IT DevOps with testing and review processes where required.Primary - Project Manager: Either directly or by working with a resource, take responsibility for key IT projects in line with good project management and governance practices. Key projects can be:Business value adding projects, such as process optimisation or implementation of digital solutions for learning.High priority and complex IT projects such as large system upgrades or implementations.Secondary: The person should be familiar with organisational design and business process design and be able to consult with the whole organisation, along with the business analysts (who would be primary in these roles, but more focused on specific work) on opportunities for improvement.Secondary: Identify and filter to the CIO any opportunities which may benefit GIBS as an organisation, which the PMO might be able to initiate and execute.',\n",
